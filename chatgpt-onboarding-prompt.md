## CONTEXT NOTES

- **Organized Categories**: Keep policies in familiar categories (Sales, Scheduling, Payments/Collections, Cancellations)
- **JSON Formatting**: Pricing data must be valid JSON arrays
- **Boolean Values**: Use TRUE/FALSE (not true/false) for sheet compatibility
- **ZIP Codes**: Always 5-digit format in quotes for JSON arrays
- **Timezone Mapping**: Convert time zones to standard format (Central, Eastern, etc.)
- **Phone Formatting**: Standard (XXX) XXX-XXXX format
- **Address Parsing**: Separate street, suite, city, state, ZIP when possible

## COMMON EXTRACTIONS

**From Transcripts Look For:**
- Company name and location
- Phone numbers and contact information
- Service descriptions and pest coverage
- Pricing information and contract terms
- Technician names and roles
- Service area coverage (ZIP codes, cities)
- Business policies and procedures
- Scheduling preferences and restrictions
- Payment policies and terms
- Emergency service availability

**Be Smart About:**
- Inferring standard policies when not explicitly stated
- Converting conversational language to structured policy titles
- Extracting pricing tiers from narrative descriptions
- Mapping geographic coverage to ZIP codes
- Identifying technician specializations and limitations
